Overview
The projects in this repository are written in C and cover a range of topics such as data structures, algorithms, file handling, memory management, and system-level programming.

These programs demonstrate the application of C language concepts, aiming to solve academic exercises and real-world problems.


Programs
Here is a brief overview of the programs included:

Program 1: intopostfix.c
Description: This program converts an arithmetic expression in infix notation (e.g., A + B) to postfix notation (e.g., AB+). Postfix notation eliminates the need for parentheses and follows the order of operations using a stack-based approach.

Program 2: linear.c
Description: This program performs a linear search on an array to find the index of a specified element. Linear search is a simple search algorithm where each element of the array is checked sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the array is reached.

Program 3: queue.c
Description: This program implements a basic queue data structure in C using an array. A queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Program 4: queueadd.c
Description: This program implements a queue using an array in C, and includes functionality to calculate and display the sum of all elements currently stored in the queue. Elements are added to the rear of the queue using the enqueue operation, and we iterate through the queue to compute the sum of its elements.

Program 5: queueeven.c
Description: This program demonstrates how to add elements to a queue (enqueue operation) and then iterate through the queue to display only the even numbers. The queue is implemented using an array in C, and elements are processed in FIFO (First In, First Out) order.

Program 6: queueprime.c
Description: This program implements a queue using an array in C and includes functionality to display the prime numbers present in the queue. It first allows the user to add elements to the queue using the enqueue operation, and then iterates through the queue to check each element for primality and display the prime numbers.

Program 7: stack.c
Description: This program demonstrates the implementation of a stack data structure using an array in C. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. The program includes functions for pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements off the stack, and displaying the current elements in the stack.

Program 8: stackeven.c
Description: This program implements a stack using an array in C and includes functionality to display the even numbers stored in the stack. The user can push elements onto the stack, and the program will then check each element for evenness before displaying the even numbers.

Program 9: stackprime.c
Description: This program implements a stack using an array in C and includes functionality to display the prime numbers stored in the stack. It allows the user to push elements onto the stack, and then iterates through the stack to check each element for primality before displaying the prime numbers.
